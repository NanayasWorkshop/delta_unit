# Delta Robot Architecture Refactoring Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Problems Identified
1. **Complex Nested Pipeline**: MotorModule creates recursive levels that are hard to follow
2. **Mixed Responsibilities**: FABRIK handles physics, MotorModule does transformations, unclear separation
3. **Multiple Coordinate Spaces**: FABRIK space vs physical segment space vs motor space - conversions scattered
4. **Collision Detection Integration**: U-points → CollisionDetector → Waypoints → back to joints is convoluted
5. **Performance Issues**: Segment calculation separated but still complex extraction from FABRIK
6. **Unclear Data Flow**: Hard to trace from target position to final motor commands

### Current Modules Status
- ✅ **Core Math/Kinematics**: Solid, keep as-is (FermatModule, KinematicsModule, etc.)
- ⚠️ **FABRIK**: Works but mixed with segment concerns
- ❌ **MotorModule**: Overly complex recursive levels
- ⚠️ **Collision**: Functional but awkward integration
- ❌ **SegmentCalculator**: Separated but still extracting from FABRIK

## Refined 3-Phase Architecture (Based on Clarifications)

### Phase 1: PLANNING (Collision-Free Path) - Target: <8ms
**Purpose**: Find collision-free virtual joint positions using FABRIK

```cpp
class PathPlanner {
public:
    static PathPlanResult plan_collision_free_path(
        const Vector3& target_position,
        const std::vector<Obstacle>& obstacles = {},
        const std::optional<std::vector<Vector3>>& current_virtual_joints = {}
    );
};
```

**Internal Flow**:
1. Initialize FABRIK chain (virtual joints for computational efficiency)
2. Run FABRIK to target with cone constraints
3. Extract U-points (real connection points) from virtual joints
4. Run collision detection on U-points (physical accuracy)
5. If collision: convert waypoints back to virtual joints, repeat
6. Output: Collision-free virtual joint positions

### Phase 2: PHYSICS (Segment Analysis) - Target: <4ms  
**Purpose**: Extract real segment end-effectors and calculate per-segment kinematics

```cpp
class SegmentPhysics {
public:
    static SegmentAnalysisResult analyze_segments(
        const std::vector<Vector3>& virtual_joint_positions,
        int num_segments = DEFAULT_ROBOT_SEGMENTS
    );
};

struct SegmentData {
    int segment_number;                    // 0, 1, 2... from base to tip
    Vector3 real_end_effector_position;    // Physical connection point (U-point)
    Vector3 direction_from_base;           // For this segment
    KinematicsResult kinematics_data;      // Calculated at (0,0,0) local frame
    OrientationResult orientation_data;    // UVW coordinate system for this segment
};
```

**Internal Flow**:
1. Extract real segment end-effectors (U-points) from virtual joints
2. For each segment: calculate kinematics as if starting from (0,0,0)
3. Calculate UVW coordinate system for segment mounting
4. Output: Complete segment physics data

### Phase 3: CONTROL (Motor Commands) - Target: <1ms
**Purpose**: Transform segments sequentially to local coordinates and extract motor commands

```cpp
class MotorController {
public:
    static MotorControlResult calculate_motor_commands(
        const SegmentAnalysisResult& segment_analysis
    );
};

struct MotorCommand {
    int segment_number;                   // 0, 1, 2... from base to tip
    double z_A, z_B, z_C;                // Linear motor positions in millimeters
    double prismatic_joint;              // Prismatic extension value
    double roll_joint, pitch_joint;      // Joint angles (degrees)
};
```

**Internal Flow**:
1. Calculate Segment 0 without any transformation (at world coordinates)
2. For each subsequent segment: transform entire chain so that segment is at (0,0,0)
3. Apply UVW coordinate stacking for each segment's motor calculation
4. Extract z_A, z_B, z_C motor positions (in mm) from local kinematics
5. Output: Direct motor commands for 60Hz real-time control

## Key Design Questions

### 1. Physical Segment Structure ✅ CLARIFIED
Each segment contains:
1. **3 mounting holes** (connection to previous segment)
2. **Pipe 1**: `WORKING_HEIGHT` length (fixed)
3. **Spherical Joint 1**: Driven by 3 linear motors (A, B, C)
4. **Pipe 2**: `MIN_HEIGHT + 2*MOTOR_LIMIT + prismatic_length` (variable)
5. **Spherical Joint 2**: Mirrors Spherical Joint 1
6. **Pipe 3**: `WORKING_HEIGHT` length (fixed)
7. **3 mounting holes** (connection to next segment)

### 2. Coordinate System Strategy ✅ CLARIFIED
**UVW Coordinate Stacking**: Each segment's kinematics calculated as if starting from (0,0,0), then transformed to align with previous segment's UVW frame. This allows reusing the same kinematic formulas for each segment.

**FABRIK vs U-Points**: 
- FABRIK works with "virtual joints" for computational simplicity (cone constraints)
- U-Points are "real connection points" (end-effector positions) for collision detection
- This separation keeps FABRIK simple while maintaining physical accuracy for collisions

### 3. Collision Detection Integration ✅ CLARIFIED
**Strategy**: Phase 1 only approach is correct
- FABRIK virtual joints → Extract U-points (real connection points)
- Collision detection on U-points (physical accuracy)
- Convert collision-free waypoints back to FABRIK joints
- This separation maintains computational efficiency while ensuring physical collision accuracy

### 4. Performance Requirements ✅ CLARIFIED
**Target**: 60Hz real-time control for smooth motion
- **Critical Path**: <16.7ms total calculation time
- **Application**: Real-time with dynamic environment
- **Interpolation**: Can interpolate between calculations if needed
- **Priority**: Smooth motion over perfect accuracy per frame

### 5. Error Handling Strategy
**Recommended**: Best effort with fallbacks for real-time requirements
- Phase 1 fails → try without collision detection (for 60Hz requirement)
- Phase 2 fails → use previous segment data with warnings
- Phase 3 fails → maintain last known motor positions

### 6. Data Flow Validation ✅ CLARIFIED
**UVW Coordinate Stacking**: The current MotorModule "levels" implement exactly this - sequentially transforming each segment to (0,0,0) world location so the same kinematic formulas can be reused per segment.

## Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Design Interfaces (New Chat Session)
1. Define exact data structures for each phase
2. Specify error handling and validation
3. Create mock implementations to test interfaces

### Step 2: Implement Phase 2 First
**Rationale**: Physics analysis is most independent, easiest to test
1. Create SegmentPhysics class
2. Test that it gives same results as current SegmentCalculator
3. Ensure kinematics/orientation integration works

### Step 3: Implement Phase 1
1. Extract FABRIK + collision logic from current modules
2. Simplify collision detection integration
3. Test that it produces valid joint positions

### Step 4: Implement Phase 3
1. Extract motor calculation logic from current MotorModule
2. Simplify coordinate transformations
3. Remove recursive level processing

### Step 5: Integration & Testing
1. Wire up all three phases
2. Compare results with current implementation
3. Performance testing and optimization

### Step 6: API Cleanup
1. Create unified public interface
2. Deprecate old complex interfaces
3. Update Python bindings

## Questions for You ✅ RESOLVED

All major architectural questions have been clarified:

1. **✅ Segment Definition**: Physical segment structure with mounting holes, pipes, and spherical joints understood
2. **✅ Coordinate Systems**: UVW coordinate stacking for reusing kinematic formulas confirmed  
3. **✅ Collision Strategy**: FABRIK virtual joints → U-points → collision detection → back to virtual joints is optimal
4. **✅ Performance Targets**: 60Hz real-time control (~16.7ms total) confirmed
5. **✅ Coordinate Stacking**: Current MotorModule "levels" correctly implement UVW stacking

## Remaining Implementation Questions ✅ RESOLVED

1. **✅ FABRIK Virtual Joint Mapping**: `UPointsExtractor` uses smart midpoint approximation between FABRIK joints. This gives <0.6% error (usually ~0%) while avoiding expensive full kinematics+orientation calculations for collision detection. Brilliant performance optimization!

2. **✅ Segment Numbering**: Segments numbered 0,1,2... from base to tip. Joints: J0=base(0,0,0), J1=first spherical joint, etc.

3. **✅ Motor Command Format**: z_A, z_B, z_C in millimeters (mm) - final output for real robot linear motors. No additional data needed currently.

4. **✅ Coordinate Transform Location**: UVW coordinate stacking happens in final phase (Phase 3) for z_A,B,C calculation only.

5. **✅ Transformation Process**: Calculate Segment 0 without transformation, then sequentially transform each subsequent segment to base (0,0,0) position - exactly as current implementation.

6. **✅ Error Handling**: Keep simple - no complex error recovery needed. Current system is stable. Focus on compact, understandable code.

7. **✅ Backward Compatibility**: Not needed - still in development. Can break current APIs.

8. **✅ Testing Strategy**: Test each phase separately, but not individual math components. Group-level testing sufficient.

9. **✅ Physical Constants**: Document which constants (WORKING_HEIGHT, MIN_HEIGHT, etc.) are used in which phase for physical reference.

10. **✅ Performance**: Current speed is optimal - no additional bottlenecks to address.

11. **✅ Future Extensibility**: 
    - Dynamic robot chain length (already handled by constants)
    - Future collision: Mesh and Voxel collision (not spherical/other types)

## Performance Targets (Revised)
- **Phase 1**: <10ms (collision detection is main bottleneck)  
- **Phase 2**: <1ms (segment analysis is fast)
- **Phase 3**: <1ms (motor calculation is fast)
- **Total**: <12ms (comfortable margin under 16.7ms for 60Hz)

## Physical Constants Reference

### Core Robot Dimensions (used across phases)
```cpp
// From constants.hpp - Physical robot parameters
ROBOT_RADIUS = 24.8           // Base mounting pattern radius
MIN_HEIGHT = 101.0           // Minimum segment extension  
WORKING_HEIGHT = 11.5        // Fixed pipe lengths
